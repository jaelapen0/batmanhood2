                All investments involve risk and the past performance of a security, 
                or financial product does not guarantee future results or returns. 
                Keep in mind that while diversification may help spread risk it does not assure a profit, 
                or protect against loss, in a down market. There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities,
                 or other financial products. Investors should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before investing.
